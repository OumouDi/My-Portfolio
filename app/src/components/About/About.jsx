      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I have a strong background in managing digital projects, and my interest
        in emerging technologies led me to transition into software development.
        I've received training in full-stack JavaScript web development and
        gained extensive skills in both front-end and back-end development. I am passionate
        about creating user-friendly and dynamic experiences while ensuring
        smooth integration with back-end functions. I enjoy working
        collaboratively and I am motivated to contribute to innovative projects.
